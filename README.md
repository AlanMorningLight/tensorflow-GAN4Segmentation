Dear Irfan,if youwant to use this code, you need to pay attention on these aspects：
first，you must fill the path of the baseline model into corresponding variable.such as the RESTORE_FROM,BASEWEIGHT_FROM,LOG_DIR and so on.All of them you need to check more than one time.
second,whatever, debug it!Good Luck!
